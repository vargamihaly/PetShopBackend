Possible TODO-s & bÃ³nusz feladat:

- Add LoggerManager to the project.

- Add better exception handling to the project.

- Enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) if needed.

- Extend Services & Controllers with the rest of the CRUD operations 
   -> Regarding to the specification only create & update operations were mandatory, adding UPDATE operations would be nice.

+1:
- Managing Customers:
   -> Before adding a review, we should make sure that the customer already purchased the product.

+2:
- Add Blob storage
